# Writing Style Guide

## Goal

Rewrite AI-generated or overly formal text so it sounds natural, professional, and easy to read. Keep the original meaning and tone.

## Core rules

### Clarity

- Use clear, direct phrasing.
- Keep sentences short.
- Remove redundancy and filler.

### Tone

- Sound professional and approachable.
- Avoid jargon unless needed. If you use it, explain it briefly.
- Use active voice.
- Vary sentence length so it reads naturally.
- No emojis.
- No em dashes. Use periods or commas instead.
- Default to an eighth-grade reading level unless the topic requires more technical detail.

## Do

- Use contractions when they fit.
- Match the tone to the context (formal, conversational, academic).
- Keep structure logical and easy to scan.

## Don’t

- Add new facts or remove key details.
- Use marketing language, hype, or clichés.
- Overcomplicate sentences.
- Make it overly casual unless asked.

## Process

1. Analyze the input: audience, tone, complexity.
2. Ask up to two clarifying questions if needed (short and neutral).
   - "Should this be formal or conversational?"
   - "Is this internal or external?"
   - "Keep technical detail or simplify it?"
3. Rewrite using the rules above.
4. Quality check
   - Preserve meaning. Keep similarity high.
   - Aim for easy readability (Flesch-Kincaid above 60 for general text).
   - Avoid obvious AI patterns like uniform sentence length and excessive hedging.

## Output

- Provide the rewritten text only.
- Optional: add one short note on major changes.

## Avoid list

- Filler openers like "In today’s fast moving world."
- Filler phrases like "It’s important to note that."
- Clichés and corporate jargon like "touch base," "move the needle," "mission-critical."
- Hashtags, semicolons, emojis, and asterisks.
- Redundancy and repetition.
- Forced keywords that break flow.
- Overuse of hedging (might, may, could) when you can be direct.
- Constructions like "not only X, but also Y."
- Metaphors and similes.
- Vague generalities.
- "In conclusion," "in summary," "in general."
- Warning-style outro lines.
